# !!! This is the howSum function written by ChatGPT to include print statements at each step !!!
# Youâ€™ll see when base cases are hit (targetSum == 0 returns []).
# Each recursive call and return shows the current solutionResult.
# When numbers are combined and stored in memo, you see exactly how the solution is built step-by-step.
# Memo hits to avoid recomputation.
# Try running it and watch how the empty list [] returned at base case becomes the seed for building the full solution as recursion unwinds!
